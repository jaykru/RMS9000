RMS9000
=======

A simple IRC bot written in Lisp using regular expressions and the cl-irc library to correct rampant misnomers.

Running it
----------
I run it in SBCL but I think most implementations of CL should work. You need quicklisp. To run it, just load the file then do (rms9000:proselytize).

License
-------
Naturally I had to use the GPLv3 for this project.

Attributions
------------
I could not have done this without anon, to whom I owe my success with their excellent copypasta. And lastly, I'd like to thank Richard Stallman for creating the GNU/Linux operating system and inspiring this endeavor.

Disclaimer
----------
Freenode will ban your IP if you abuse this bot. Don't ask how I know. So yeah, don't do that. Also, don't abuse this too much. Don't be a dick.
